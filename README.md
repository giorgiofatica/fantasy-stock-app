# Stockpile

A fantasy investing app where friends draft real stocks and compete in leagues using simulated money and real market data. Weekly head-to-head matchups turn portfolio performance into standings, playoffs, and season results.

Built by [Giorgio Fatica](https://github.com/giorgiofatica). [Portfolio](https://giorgioportfolio.vercel.app/) · [Public landing page](https://fantasy-stock-app.vercel.app/)

## Current status

**Pre-launch, in closed testing.** React Native is the primary app; the public website is a landing page, and public registration remains closed.

As of **October 22, 2026**, the core league flow includes server-side draft validation, season schedule generation, weekly scoring, standings, and playoffs. The `main` branch carries the 1.3 mobile release work, including the redesigned interface and onboarding. It also has invite links, Sign in with Apple and Google, and in-app account deletion (with the server side live since October 22). The 1.3 release remains in preparation, with real-device checks and distribution setup outstanding.

The [project status log](docs/STATUS.md) records deployment evidence, release constraints, and remaining work. This README summarizes the project; the status log tracks operations.

## The experience

- **Create a league:** choose a season format, roster size, stock categories, and stake rules, then invite friends.
- **Draft a portfolio:** take turns choosing stocks in a snake draft, with a pick clock, queue, and server-side automatic picks.
- **Compete each week:** compare dollar gains in head-to-head matchups, follow standings, and advance through playoffs. A duration format supports a single longer competition.
- **Manage the season:** make simulated trades, inspect portfolio performance, and retain results across seasons.
- **Join and come back:** join from an invite link, sign in with Apple, Google, or email, and run a finished league back for another season with the same group.
- **Leave cleanly:** delete your account in the app. Past seasons keep your results under "Open team", and the commissioner can hand your team to someone new with a takeover link.

No brokerage account or real-money deposit is required. [The design decision behind simulated investing](docs/decisions/DR-001-in-house-simulated-trading.md) explains the scope and tradeoffs.

## Technical decisions worth exploring

| Problem | Approach | Where to look |
|---|---|---|
| Drafts and trades must obey league rules even when clients send conflicting requests. | Validate picks on the server and use database transactions for trade recording. | [Draft validation](supabase/functions/validate-and-record-pick/), [trade transaction tests](supabase/tests/record_trade_atomic.pglite.test.ts) |
| Missing market prices or partial snapshots must not silently produce an incomplete score. | Track coverage per participant, retry incomplete work, and refuse scoring when required data is missing. | [Week-start snapshots](supabase/functions/snapshot-week-start/), [week-end snapshots](supabase/functions/snapshot-week-end/), [scoring](supabase/functions/process-week-results/) |
| A database migration can apply successfully while its functions behave incorrectly. | Execute SQL against PGlite test databases and keep separate checks of deployed behavior. | [SQL test guide](supabase/tests/README.md), [deployment evidence](docs/STATUS.md) |
| Deleting an account must finish, and stay honest, even if a step fails midway. | Record each deletion in a ledger that moves through fixed stages, have an hourly job finish any interrupted one, and mark it done only after the sign-in record is verified gone. | [Deletion ledger and scrub](supabase/migrations/20261125000003_account_deletions_ledger.sql), [delete-account](supabase/functions/delete-account/), [hourly heal](supabase/functions/heal-account-deletions/) |
| Documentation can drift from a growing backend. | Generate an architecture map from migrations and client call sites, alongside a dated database snapshot. | [Architecture map and sources](docs/architecture/) |

## Local development

Use **Node.js 22.13+ on the 22.x line, or Node.js 24.x**, npm, and [Deno](https://deno.com/). The mobile app also needs a compatible simulator or development build. The repository uses [gitleaks](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks) for staged secret scanning.

From the repository root:

```bash
npm ci
brew install gitleaks  # macOS; use the upstream installation guide on other systems
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
```

The mobile app has its own package lock and is installed separately:

```bash
(cd apps/mobile && npm ci)
```

Configure a development Supabase project before starting an app. These examples use placeholders; use only publishable keys in client configuration.

**Web — `apps/web/.env.local`:**

```dotenv
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_publishable_key
VITE_HCAPTCHA_SITE_KEY=your_hcaptcha_site_key
```

**Mobile — `apps/mobile/.env`:**

```dotenv
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_publishable_key
```

Backend secrets and data-vendor credentials belong in the server environment. Full backend provisioning and authentication-provider setup are separate from installing the frontend dependencies; see the [documentation index](docs/README.md) and [repo conventions](CLAUDE.md).

Start either frontend from its own directory:

```bash
# Web
(cd apps/web && npm run dev)

# Mobile
(cd apps/mobile && npx expo start)
```

The web app currently has `APP_PAUSED = true` in `apps/web/src/App.jsx`, so its normal entry point shows the landing page. A successful web build alone does not validate the gated application screens. Mobile native integrations require a matching development build; the [simulator guide](docs/testing/MOBILE_SIMULATOR.md) covers the project's fixture-based UI review workflow.

## Testing

The repo includes Deno tests for backend logic, PGlite tests that execute SQL migrations, frontend tests, and device walkthroughs. From the repository root:

```bash
# Backend and SQL tests (edge-function logic, plus PGlite runs of the migrations)
deno test --allow-read --allow-env supabase/

# Mobile app logic, copy, and layout rules
(cd apps/mobile/tests-deno && deno test --allow-read --allow-env --allow-sys --allow-run .)

# Generated architecture map freshness
node scripts/gen-architecture.mjs --check

# Frontend checks
(cd apps/web && npm run lint && npm run test && npm run typecheck)
(cd apps/mobile && npm run lint && npx tsc --noEmit)
```

See the [SQL test guide](supabase/tests/README.md) for individual database suites and their permissions, and the [1.3 device walkthrough](docs/testing/WALKTHROUGH_1.3.md) for release checks. Season simulations use a configured backend and are documented separately in the [simulation guide](docs/testing/SEASON_SIMULATION_TEST.md).
