// Phase 3b-1 — WHEN a stored deep link is resumed.
//
// app/+native-intent.tsx records every incoming system link here before the
// router sees it; app/_layout.tsx reports each auth phase change and
// navigates to whatever authChanged() returns.
//
// The one subtle case is a cold start while ALREADY signed in: the link
// arrives while auth is still 'unknown', and the router opens it natively
// once the stack renders. Replaying it would push the screen twice. So a
// link is only replayed when the user reaches 'ready' FROM a state in which
// they could not have opened it themselves ('signedOut' or 'gated').
//
// Pure (no React Native imports) so tests-deno can exercise it hermetically.
