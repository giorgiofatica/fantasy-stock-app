/**
 * DEV-ONLY Home fixtures (Phase 3b-2), for states that can't reliably be
 * reached live: playoffs, season-complete, a forced leader flip, and — on
 * a dev machine whose test league isn't mid-scoring right now — the
 * scoring/scored transition. Same safety model as
 * lib/shell/devFixture.ts: read only under `__DEV__`, gated by an env var,
 * never touches Supabase for the faked state.
 *
 * This file holds ONLY the `__DEV__`/env-var gate. The actual sample
 * numbers live in ./homeFixtureData.ts (no `__DEV__` reference), which
 * this file re-exports for app callers — split out because Deno (this
 * repo's hermetic test runtime, tests-deno/) cannot resolve the RN global
 * `__DEV__`, and a module-top-level reference to it makes the WHOLE
 * module unimportable under `deno test`, even for callers that only want
 * the pure data. lib/shell/devFixture.ts has the same shape and is,
 * accordingly, never imported by any deno test either — this module
 * keeps that constraint from spreading to the data itself.
