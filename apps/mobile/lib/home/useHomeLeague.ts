 * useHomeLeague: the data half of Phase 3b-2 Home. Fetches summary
 * (already in LeagueContext — no new request) + get_home_league + quote
 * + historical-bars (or substitutes the dev fixture), then hands
 * everything to the pure buildHomeViewModel for the actual decisions.
 *
 * Request budget (spec: "at most 5 requests on load"): get_home_summary
 * is LeagueContext's own fetch, shared across the whole app, not counted
 * again here. This hook itself issues at most 3: get_home_league, quote,
 * historical-bars — 4 total with the summary, inside the ≤5 budget.
 * `__DEV__` request logging (`[home] N requests`) is how the worker's
 * DONE report states the count.
 *
 * Per-state extras NOT fetched here (get_draft_order, get_draft_clock,
 * playoff bracket rows): the pre_draft/drafting/playoff phase cards fetch
 * those themselves, only when that phase is actually shown — this hook's
 * job is the money views (hero, this-week, season, standings), which
