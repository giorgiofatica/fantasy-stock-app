// Onboarding W3 — what happens to a pending invite once the person is `ready`: the decisions, pure.
//
// The screen (app/join-league.tsx, invite mode) asks the same two server functions the manual flow does
// (preview-league, then join-league), and every answer maps here to ONE of: join now, open the league, show
// "You're in", show a refusal, or show a transport error, plus what to do with the STORED invite. The server's
// join-league is the only truth (a league can start or fill between the tap and the join); this table only
// reads its answer. Copy is never made here: the refusal wording is lib/join/joinPreview.ts's.
//
// The invite's fate follows one rule (the partial-state rule in CLAUDE.md, applied to this flow):
//   - a DEFINITIVE answer (joined, already a member, any refusal, a bad code) -> `clear`, and the person is
//     SHOWN why, never silently dropped;
//   - a TRANSPORT failure (network, 429, 5xx) -> `keep`: the invite waits for the person's tap, and a relaunch
//     tries once more. Nothing here retries by itself, so nothing can loop.
//
// Pure (no React Native imports) so tests-deno can exercise it hermetically.
