// The CODE is the sole capability join_league_by_code needs, so a link is a bearer token: it is read
// from the PATH only (never a query or fragment), must be the SHAPE a code can have, and anything else

// (https://fantasy-stock-app.vercel.app.evil.com/..., a userinfo '@' trick) never parses.
//
// Pure (no React Native imports) so tests-deno can exercise it hermetically.
