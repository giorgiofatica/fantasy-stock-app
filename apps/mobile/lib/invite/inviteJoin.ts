// Onboarding W3 — the invite flow of app/join-league.tsx (invite mode), as one pure, dependency-injected
// sequence: preview -> (markTried BEFORE the join) -> join -> the invite's fate. The screen only draws the
// result, so every partial-state path is testable end to end without React Native (tests-deno).
//
// lib/invite/autoJoin.ts holds the per-answer decisions and their reasoning; this module strings them together
// and applies the fate: a definitive answer CLEARS the stored invite and hands the screen the reason to show,
// a transport failure KEEPS it and hands back the error. Nothing here loops or retries.
