// Onboarding W2 (PKCE) — a floor between two confirmation emails to the same address.
//
// "Send again" repeats signUp() (lib/SessionProvider.tsx). Under PKCE a signUp() REPLACES the one
// stored code verifier, and supabase-js DELETES it when the call errors. GoTrue refuses a second email
// inside its minimum interval (default 60 s, over_email_send_rate_limit), so a "Send again" tapped too
// soon would fail AND destroy the verifier the first, still-valid email needs: its link would then
// confirm the address but could not sign this device in. So a repeat inside the interval is not sent at
// all; the person sees the existing "Too many attempts — please wait a minute and try again." line
// (getAuthErrorMessage) instead. Pure and clock-injected so tests-deno can drive it.
