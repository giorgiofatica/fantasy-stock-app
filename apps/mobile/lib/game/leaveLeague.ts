/**
 * Leaving a league, and handing over the commissioner's title (3c-2, item 13;
 * board #call-leave, ruled by Giorgio 2026-10-06; refusal lines from the UX
 * audit's Rule 8 table › leave-league). The leave-league edge function and its
 * RPCs (#126, #132) own every rule; this file only mirrors the window for the
 * row's display and maps outcomes to copy. The server is the gate: if the
 * client's window read is stale, the refusal shows the right line.
 *
 * The flow stays behind EXPO_PUBLIC_LEAVE_LEAGUE=1 (the kill switch). Pure: the
 * caller passes the flag value in, so the rule is testable without process.env.
