/**
 * draftTimeSheet (3c-2; Giorgio's ruling B on board #call-ux-pass1, PR #140):
 * the Draft time sheet holds the time it shows LOCALLY and writes only on
 * "Set draft time". The wheel spinning writes nothing, and × or a swipe closes
 * without saving: the 1.1.0 half-save (the picker wrote as it spun, Done only
 * closed, so a swipe-away kept a time you were still scrolling to) is gone.
 * "Set later" (only where a time is optional) writes "no time".
 *
 * Pure, so a dismiss-writes-nothing test runs the same steps the sheet does.
