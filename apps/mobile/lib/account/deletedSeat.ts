// Account deletion (W4) — what a deleted manager's seat is called, and how the app knows a name is that seat.
//
// The server owns the word: deleted_manager_label() is the one SQL constant, and league_participant_display_name
// already returns it for a deleted seat, so every mobile name that arrives from the server arrives as the label.
// The app therefore needs the label for exactly two things: (1) to recognise a seat, so its avatar is the default
// person glyph and never initials of the label (Giorgio's board pick), and (2) to fill the delete screen's lines
// (the takeover question is fixed text and no longer takes it). OPEN_TEAM_FALLBACK is the ONE client literal: it stands in until the server's
// answer has been read once, and is never used when the server's is known.
//
// RECOGNISING A SEAT BY ITS NAME is safe only because the label is a reserved sentinel: it contains a space and
// usernames are ^[A-Za-z0-9_]{3,20}$ (lib/shell/usernameRules.ts, the server's CHECK), so no person can be
// called it. tests-deno pins that. Not an overloaded NULL: an explicit value nobody else can hold. This is the
// ONE place the comparison lives (isDeletedSeatName), so an explicit server flag would swap one function.
//
// Pure (no React Native / supabase imports) so tests-deno exercises it hermetically; the fetch is
// lib/account/deletedLabelStore.ts.
