// Account deletion (W4) — the delete screen's one line per league (board pick B). Pure.
//
// What happens to each league mirrors the server's scrub (plan 2026-10-21 › The system's side), decided from facts
// the app already reads: the leave window (lib/game/leaveLeague.ts, the same order of checks as the server), whether
// the person is the commissioner, and who else is in the league. Which line applies, in order:
//   1. a league they run with nobody else in it  -> deleted with the account (any window)
//   2. before the draft                          -> they simply leave it
//   3. a league they run, others in it           -> "{earliest member} becomes the commissioner."
//   4. a league they play in                     -> "The commissioner can hand it to a new manager."
//   5. a finished season you only PLAYED in      -> "Your team stays as “Open team”." alone: nothing is left to hand
//      over (plan decision 9; Design Lead, 2026-10-21). One you RAN with others is rule 3: the title passes in every
//      window, so the full approved line names the successor.
// The successor is picked the way the server picks: earliest `joined_at`, then `user_id`; leavers, deleted seats
// and bots never count.
