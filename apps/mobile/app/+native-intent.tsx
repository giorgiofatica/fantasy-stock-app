// link opened while running) BEFORE it routes. The link is recorded so the

// the router still handles it, and Stack.Protected (app/_layout.tsx) sends a
// signed-out user to sign-in instead of rendering the guarded screen.
// lib/shell/pendingRoute.ts decides whether the recorded link is ever
// replayed; lib/shell/resumeTarget.ts decides whether it is allowed to be.
