# supabase/tests: SQL tests against real Postgres

The tests here execute migrations against a **real Postgres 16** (PGlite, Postgres
compiled to WASM, running in-process under Deno). The hermetic unit tests live next to
their modules in `supabase/functions/`. The tests in this folder are the counterpart
for SQL. PL/pgSQL resolves names only at execution time, so a migration that applies
cleanly proves nothing about its function bodies (`CLAUDE.md`).

They are **deliberately outside `supabase/functions/`**. That keeps
`deno test supabase/functions/` offline and hermetic, with no npm fetch and no WASM.

## replica_defaults.ts (shared guard, not a test)

Most suites hand-declare a minimal `leagues` table. If a replica's column default differs from prod's, a fixture that omits the column tests a different branch from the one prod runs.

This happened on 2026-10-06. The leave-league replica defaulted `league_type` to `'matchup'`, but prod's default is `'duration'`. So the effect test's S4 passed in PGlite and failed in prod.

`assertReplicaDefaultMatchesProd(q, 'leagues', 'league_type')` compares the replica's `information_schema` default with the default the latest migration leaves. Four suites call it as a step:
- `leave_league`
- `start_league_playoffs`
- `flexible_playoffs`
- `season_result`

Each of them declares `default 'duration'`, like prod, and passes `league_type` explicitly wherever a matchup path is under test.

**When a new suite declares `league_type`, call the guard too.**

## finalize_league_draft.pglite.test.ts

What it does:
- Loads `supabase/migrations/20260926000000_finalize_league_draft_rpc.sql`
  **verbatim** onto a minimal replica of the schema it touches.
- Simulates Supabase's `ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES` grants to `anon`/`authenticated`,
  so the `proacl` assertion proves the explicit revokes work. `REVOKE FROM PUBLIC`
  alone would fail it.
- Drives the migration with payloads from the real planner in
  `supabase/functions/_shared/schedule.ts`.

It covers:
- grants and the pinned `search_path`
- the season-1 backfill and its idempotency
- the happy path, and a re-run that is a no-op
- odd rosters and `num_weeks` COALESCE
- duration leagues
- 14 payload/roster refusals, each asserted to write nothing and leave the draft
  `in_progress`
- partial schedule vs. partial standings
- season-N re-scheduling
- PR #9's leagues trigger contract
- the stuck-draft detector query in the migration header

## league_standings_ranked.pglite.test.ts

What it does:
- Loads the three `20261011*` ranking migrations **verbatim**, on top of the real
  prior definitions they replace: `20261004000000` + `20261004000001` whole, and
  `complete_league_season` sliced out of `20260125000000` with its lockdown grants
  (`20260718000002`) and `search_path` pin (`20260724000002`).
- Recreates the prod members-only SELECT policies (with `is_member()` sliced out of
  `20260712000000`) so the INVOKER function runs under real RLS.

It covers:
- grants and security mode; the two re-created functions' `proacl`, `prosecdef`
  and `proconfig` byte-identical before/after
- the motivating 5-1 vs 5-1 case, including `get_home_summary`'s rank flipping
  from 2nd to 1st
- win % over non-bye games (ties half; uneven byes; 0 games played = 0%), 2-/3-/4-way H2H (balanced, cycle, unbalanced, never-met,
  recursive subgroups), byes, unscored and playoff games ignored
- the pre-season join-order key, the playoff-cutoff case, ranks exactly 1..N
- RLS (member / non-member / anon) and `complete_league_season`'s snapshot

## league_standings_through_week.pglite.test.ts

What it does:
- Loads `20261011000000` (the 1-arg ranking) and then `20261112000000` (the
  through-week overload) **verbatim**, on the real `is_member()` helper and the
  league-wide SELECT policies from production.
- Derives `league_standings` from `matchups` the way process-week-results
  writes it (a bye adds points only; playoff rows add nothing), so the two
  rankings must agree by construction.

It covers:
- through the latest scored week equals the 1-arg ranking; playoff week excluded
- a bye adds points only; exact rows and `points_against` at week 2
- the week-1 order (a tie decided by join order)
- ranks 1..N; the 1-arg ACL unchanged by the migration
- grants: authenticated and service_role present, anon and PUBLIC absent, on
  both overloads and the private core
- call-time: a member gets the ranking, a non-member gets zero rows (RLS), anon
  is refused, a NULL or negative week raises

Head-to-head: covered for a win-% tie that head-to-head separates (join order
and season gain both point the other way), and for an unbalanced set that
falls through to season gain. Both assert through-latest equals the 1-arg.

Known gap (accepted for 1.2.0): the roster comes from `league_standings`, as in
the 1-arg. A manager whose standings row failed to write is dropped by both
overloads. The follow-up fix must change both together.

## start_league_playoffs.pglite.test.ts

What it does: loads `20261011000003` and the `20261011000004` backstop index
**verbatim** on a replica of `matchups`' unique keys and `valid_playoff_round` check. It drives the function with brackets from the
real `buildPlayoffBracket` (`process-week-results/season-transition.ts`).

It covers:
- grants (DEFINER, `service_role` only)
- claim + full bracket insert
- idempotency: a repeat call is `already_transitioned` and writes nothing
- atomicity: a bad timestamp or duplicate key rolls back the claim, and a retry then
  succeeds
- no re-claim with existing playoff rows or a non-active status
- compare-and-swap: a stale `p_expected_week` is `not_eligible` and writes nothing
- backstop index: a non-atomic second bracket is rejected, while normal winner
  advancement (4- and 8-team) never trips it
- 17 write-free refusals
- anon/authenticated denied

PGlite has one connection, so true concurrency is argued in the migration header (row
lock + READ COMMITTED re-check of `season_status`), not executed.

## bye_recompute.pglite.test.ts

Runs the hand-run HUMAN ACTION `docs/migrations/bye-no-result-standings-recompute.sql`
**verbatim**. Steps 1–2 run as written; step 3 has its `-- ` prefix stripped and the
league id substituted. It proves:
- steps 1–2 find the legacy bye wins and the managers they inflate;
- step 3 corrects W/L/T only for the target league, keeps `points_for`, and rewrites
  legacy bye rows to the no-result shape;
- a completed season is never touched.

### Run (from the repo root)

```bash
deno test --allow-read --allow-env supabase/tests/
```

The first run fetches `npm:@electric-sql/pglite` (pinned in `deno.lock`) into the
Deno cache and the root `node_modules/.deno/`, which is gitignored. Later runs are
offline. No DB, no Docker, no secrets.

### PR #9's leagues trigger

The "PR #9 trigger" step loads `enforce_leagues_member_update_columns` /
`trg_leagues_member_update_columns` **verbatim**. It looks in two places:

1. `supabase/migrations/*_leagues_member_draft_complete_column_guard.sql`.
   PR #9 merged (`5e3b5d1`) with this file at `20260925000000`, so on `main` the
   step picks it up automatically and **runs**. Expect 25 steps passed and 0
   ignored.
2. The file named by `PR9_TRIGGER_SQL`, for older branches that predate the merge.
   Nothing is vendored:

   ```bash
   git show origin/main:supabase/migrations/20260925000000_leagues_member_draft_complete_column_guard.sql > /tmp/pr9_trigger.sql
   ```
   ```bash
   PR9_TRIGGER_SQL=/tmp/pr9_trigger.sql deno test --allow-read --allow-env supabase/tests/
   ```

If neither is found, the step reports **ignored**, never passed. So an unrun trigger
check stays visible in the summary.

## draft_pick_clock.pglite.test.ts

Loads `supabase/migrations/20261010000000_draft_pick_clock_and_queue.sql` verbatim, together with PR #9's leagues column guard. It covers the pick clock (trigger, CHECK, lock, deadline math, overdue list), the draft queue (RLS and `set_draft_queue`), grants (proacl, and in practice), and `auto_pick_search_candidates` compared against its TS mirror, which uses `effectiveCategoryIds`, the rule the pick gate uses. It also runs `docs/security/draft-pick-clock-effect-test.sql` itself. That is the file Giorgio runs in the SQL editor after the push, and every line must PASS here first.

## draft_order_modes.pglite.test.ts

Loads `20261013000000_draft_order_modes.sql` verbatim, on top of (all verbatim, in timestamp order) PR #9's leagues column guard, the pick-clock migration, `20261011000003`/`04`, and flexible playoffs `20261012000000`–`03`. That proves it applies cleanly on what prod will have, and that all `leagues` triggers (column guard, playoff-teams freeze, order mode, pick clock, order start) fire together in their real order. It covers:
- grants: proacl, relacl, and the column-level UPDATE on `league_notifications`
- the legacy backfill, byte-identical to the deleted `computeDraftOrder`, with mixed-case and bot ids
- reveal gating at `draft_date − 1h`, and generated-exactly-once
- the **no-commissioner-first regression**, 200 trials on each of four paths, with the commissioner reading the order after every join. This test caught a real bug before the first commit: finalizing with only the commissioner in the league put them first 200/200.
- the 4-member floor
- manual seed / save / refusals, and the mode-change rules
- joins and leaves in each state
- the start backstop, the reconcile and the lock
- immutability for every role
- the league-delete cascade
- the cron work list

It also runs `docs/security/draft-order-modes-effect-test.sql`, which must show exactly 24 PASS.

## draft_order_no_derivation.test.ts

A structural guard. No production file may call `computeDraftOrder` or re-implement the commissioner filter+sort; the draft order is stored. It reads files only: `deno test --allow-read supabase/tests/draft_order_no_derivation.test.ts`.

## draft_insert_sites.test.ts

A structural guard. Only `insertGatedPick` (gated picks) and `insertSkip` (SKIP rows) may write `drafts`, and only `gatePick` may produce a `GatedPick`. It reads files only: `deno test --allow-read supabase/tests/draft_insert_sites.test.ts`.

## username_write_path.pglite.test.ts

What it does:
- Loads `20261007000000_username_write_path.sql` **verbatim**, on top of the five
  earlier `user_profiles` migrations, also verbatim. Those five give it the real
  table, the `LOWER(username)` unique index, the RLS policies and the
  `handle_new_user_profile` signup trigger.
- Stubs only the Supabase shell: the roles and their default grants, a three-column
  `auth.users`, `auth.uid()` (the real body), and the `supabase_realtime`
  publication.

It covers:
- regex parity between the CHECK, both RPCs and the trigger
- the migration failing closed on a violating row (nothing half-applied)
- `convalidated`
- grants, `SECURITY DEFINER` and `search_path`
- the CHECK on direct writes
- `set_username`: ok, idempotent, re-casing your own name, taken
  (case-insensitive), invalid (including NULL, `''`, `\n` and non-ASCII), and the
  no-row insert arm
- a simulated `unique_violation` race → `taken`
- `check_usernames`: order, duplicates, the NULL element, the 10/11 cap, and
  NULL/`{}` input
- no-JWT and anon → 42501
- direct DML through the real RLS policies
- the signup trigger after the CHECK

Mutation-checked on 2026-09-29. Each of these is caught:
- dropping the own-row exclusion
- keeping the anon grant (caught by two steps)
- removing the `unique_violation` handler
- letting NULL through `set_username`

It **cannot** prove the following (the file header lists them). The SQL-editor test
`docs/security/username-write-path-effect-test.sql` still owns them:
- prod's real roles and grants
- PostgREST/GoTrue JWT handling
- the real `auth.users` and GoTrue's signup transaction
- real concurrency (PGlite is one connection; the race is simulated with a
  test-only trigger)
- prod data (the migration's PRE-CHECK covers that)

Running it may rewrite `deno.lock` with unrelated npm workspace churn. Don't commit
that as part of a test change.

## flexible_playoffs.pglite.test.ts

What it does:
- Loads the prior definitions (`20261011000003` `start_league_playoffs`, the
  `20261011000004` backstop index) on a replica of `leagues`/`matchups` with the
  OLD `IN (2,4,8)` and 3-round CHECKs.
- Inserts **legacy fixtures** (a finished 4-team bracket, an in-flight 8-team one,
  NULL `playoff_teams`, live and finished leagues) **before** applying
  `20261012000000`–`03` verbatim, so the backfills run against real legacy data.
- Drives the function with brackets from the real `buildPlayoffBracket`, and
  advances winners with the real `planAdvance` plus the same conditional,
  addressed UPDATE `advancePlayoffWinner` issues.

It covers:
- bracket-address backfill (the in-flight 8-team bracket gets exactly
  `planBracket`'s addresses), NULL → 4 on matchup leagues only, the new CHECKs,
  and the `league_end_date` extension (live only; idempotent)
- acceptance of the exact bracket for every P from 2 to 16 (byes pre-placed in
  round 2), P below the member count, and P = 17 refused (`bracket_too_large`)
- 20 shape refusals, each asserted to write nothing
- a full tournament for every P: every slot is filled when its week starts,
  nobody plays twice in a week, retries are no-ops, and there is one champion
- the `playoff_teams` freeze, including the designed order (lower P while
  `not_started`, then start) and the service-role exemption
- `proacl` of the replaced function and the new trigger function

`start_league_playoffs.pglite.test.ts` now loads the whole chain through
`20261012000003`, so it tests the live definition. Its backstop steps test the
address index that replaced it.


## season_result.pglite.test.ts

What it does:
- Loads `20261014000000` (`get_season_result`) and `20261014000001` (the
  `league_seasons` commissioner-write drop) **verbatim**, on top of the real
  functions they read or depend on: `is_member` (sliced), `participant_display_name`,
  `league_standings_ranked`, `complete_league_season` (`20261011000002`), and
  `start_new_league_season` (sliced from `20260718000000`). It also loads both prod
  `league_seasons` policies, sliced from `20260125000000`.
- Every `final_standings` is written by the **real** `complete_league_season`, so
  `final_rank` is the unified ranking's output, never a hand-typed number.
- Simulates Supabase's default EXECUTE and table-ALL grants to the API roles, so the
  `proacl` and table-grant assertions prove the explicit revokes work.

It covers:
- grants: DEFINER, authenticated only, `search_path` pinned; anon, service_role and a
  missing `sub` are all refused
- the policy drop:
  - the FOR ALL hole is reproduced BEFORE the migration;
  - after it, a commissioner's UPDATE (champion / final_standings), INSERT and
    DELETE fail with 42501, and a member still reads;
  - the DEFINER completion and `start_new_league_season` still write
- a 4-team league: the champion, the runner-up and an eliminated semifinalist; the
  best week; `final_rank` equal to the stored rank
- a 6-team league with P=6: a bye seed losing its first game (0-1, round 2), the
  wild-card exit (round 1), and the champion at 3-0
- a 5-team odd roster: a bye adds no W/L/T, but it can be the best week; a manager who
  missed the playoffs
- 12 `inconsistent` refusals, each checked from a third member's seat with every
  derived field NULL:
  - `champion_mismatch` (a forged champion, a forged runner-up)
  - `weeks_unscored` (a week unscored, a week missing)
  - `points_for_mismatch`
  - `playoffs_unscored` (a game unscored, all games missing)
  - `playoff_final_unresolved`
  - `playoff_shape_mismatch`
  - `standings_missing_participant`
  - `final_standings_missing`
  - `season_status_mismatch`
- `not_complete` (no podium, even with the final scored), and `no_season`
- the archived season after `start_new_league_season`:
  - `standings_only`;
  - the default picks the last *completed* season;
  - eliminated vs missed is NULL, not guessed;
  - a member who joined later gets `caller_participated = false`
- 0 rows for a non-member, an unknown league, and a season from another league

## f8_push_tokens.pglite.test.ts

What it does:
- Loads `supabase/migrations/20261017000000_f8_push_tokens_relocation.sql` **verbatim**
  onto a replica of prod's `user_profiles` (the token column and its index, the three
  prod policies, and membership in `supabase_realtime`), with Supabase's default
  table grants simulated.

It covers:
- the finding reproduced BEFORE the migration (any authenticated user reads another's token)
- the backfill (non-null tokens only, keyed by user)
- the column dropped from the published table (the Realtime vector), while cross-user
  username/avatar reads keep working
- `push_tokens` not in `supabase_realtime`
- owner-only SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE, and the 1.1.0 client's upsert + logout delete
- anon holds no privilege at all (not merely RLS-empty)
- service_role reads any token (send-notification's admin client)
- the `auth.users` delete cascade

Mutation-checked: an open SELECT policy, a missing anon revoke, or a kept column
each fail their own step.

## lock_start_new_league_season.pglite.test.ts

What it does:
- Rebuilds the function's real prod ACL history **verbatim**: the body and grant
  lines from `20260718000000`, then the grant lines from `20260718000001`, under
  simulated Supabase default grants. The pre-state therefore has
  `authenticated=X` and `service_role=X`, matching the prod snapshot.
- Applies `20261023000000_lock_start_new_league_season.sql` whole.
- Runs the migration header's POST-PUSH **DO-block effect check**,
  un-commented, both before the migration (it must report `FAIL`) and after it
  (it must report `PASS -- 42501`). So the HUMAN ACTION query is proven able
  to tell the two apart, and to pick a UUID-shaped commissioner over a newer
  `bot-*` one.

It covers:
- the pre-state: the commissioner reaches the body, and it really DELETEs the
  league's matchups (inside a rolled-back transaction);
- `proacl` = `{postgres=X/postgres}` exactly, with one overload kept (not dropped);
- the authenticated commissioner, anon and service_role each refused with
  `42501`, with matchups, seasons, standings and the leagues row unchanged;
- the owner keeps EXECUTE (its call reaches the body's own commissioner gate,
  `P0001`), so the function stays restorable;
- re-applying the migration is a no-op.

## draft_feasibility_pool (draft-never-skips, 2026-10-05)

`draft_feasibility_pool.pglite.test.ts` — the SQL pool groups == the TS
`buildPoolGroups` on one fixture, and the service-role-only grant.
Run: `deno test --allow-read --allow-env supabase/tests/draft_feasibility_pool.pglite.test.ts`
(first run fetches `npm:@electric-sql/pglite`).

## record_trade_atomic.pglite.test.ts

What it does:
- Loads **verbatim**: the trades table and its RLS (`20250118000000`), the quantity
  widening (`20260810000000`), `funded_by_trade_id` and its unique index
  (`20261006000000`), the client-INSERT policy drop (`20260811000002`), and
  `20261102000000_record_trade_atomic.sql`. leagues, league_members, drafts and
  league_draft_slots are replicas of the columns the function reads.
- Drives the function through record-trade's **real** write path:
  `commitWithRetry` + `decideTrade` (`supabase/functions/record-trade/commit.ts`)
  over the real validator. Only the reads are SQL instead of paginated PostgREST;
  pagination is covered hermetically in `record-trade/commit.test.ts`.
- Forces each race's losing interleaving deterministically: A and B both read, A
  commits, then B submits its stale view.

It covers:
- grants: INVOKER, VOLATILE, `service_role` only, `search_path` pinned; anon is
  denied, and a *leaked* authenticated grant still cannot insert (trades RLS)
- structure: the advisory lock precedes every table read, with the key pinned
- the races, each with exactly one row committed and the loser's game refusal:
  - double sell → `not_owned`, net position 0
  - double budget_cap buy → `symbol_owned`
  - two buys that each fit the budget alone → `over_budget`
  - double price_tiers buy → `symbol_owned`
  - two buys racing for the last roster spot → `roster_full`
  - cross-user same symbol → `symbol_owned`, one owner
  - two buys into one skipped fixed_notional slot → `no_proceeds`
  - two buys reinvesting the same named sale → `proceeds_unavailable`
- the CAS: a moved trade, a deleted draft pick, each of the five rules columns,
  and a slot edit or insert are each `ledger_changed` naming what moved; exact-set
  semantics (missing, extra, duplicated id); numerics compared by value (no
  spurious conflict); a sell is not refused by a rules edit it never read; a
  mid-flight budget edit re-validates under the new rules
- **`trade_conflict` means nothing was traded:** a neighbour commits between
  every read and its RPC, so all 3 attempts of a FUNDED fixed_notional buy get
  `ledger_changed`. The test asserts `trade_conflict`, that every attempt really
  was funded by the sale, that only the neighbour's rows are new, and that no
  `funded_by_trade_id` row exists in the league and the sale is claimed nowhere.
  (The hermetic side, `trade_conflict` ONLY when every attempt was
  `ledger_changed`, never after an rpc `{ error }`, a timeout or a 23505, is in
  `record-trade/commit.test.ts`.)
- write-free refusals: `not_a_member`, `league_not_found`, `bad_request`,
  `draft_not_completed`
- the funded index is mapped inside the RPC **by name**; any other constraint
  still raises
- the migration header's HUMAN ACTION **DO-block effect check**, run verbatim:
  PASS on this function, FAIL on one with the CAS neutered, and it rolls back
  either way

What it cannot show: two truly concurrent transactions blocking on the advisory
lock. PGlite has one connection, so the lock rests on the argument in the migration
header plus the structure step.

Mutation-checked (each fails at least one step):
- neutering the trades CAS (11 steps, including the trade_conflict proof);
- neutering the drafts CAS;
- dropping DISTINCT from the seen-set join;
- removing the NULL-element guard;
- removing the lock (the structure step);
- `STABLE` instead of `VOLATILE` (every step: a STABLE function cannot INSERT);
- removing the READ COMMITTED guard;
- `MAX_ATTEMPTS = 1`, i.e. no retry (10 steps here, plus 6 hermetic tests).

Also covered: jsonb `'null'` for rules/slots reads as not given (a sell still
commits), and the function refuses to run under REPEATABLE READ.

### record_trade_atomic.pglite.test.ts: tier slots (20261103000000)

The same file also loads `20261103000000_trades_slot_id.sql` (adds `trades.slot_id`,
drops the 12-arg overload, adds `p_slot_id`) and drives it through the real
`commitWithRetry` + `decideTrade`. The steps:
- exactly ONE `record_trade_atomic` (13 args) and the 12-arg signature is gone;
  the proacl lockdown is re-asserted on the new signature;
- the repro end to end: NVDA in hi, a $100 buy fills lo and records `slot_id`, a $150
  buy is refused `no_eligible_slot` with `open_slots: []`; sell-then-buy fills the freed
  tier; draft-sell-rebuy counts the buy's slot once;
- race 3c: two different symbols into one free tier slot, the loser re-validates;
- legacy rows: a NULL-slot buy occupies its derived tier, and a manager already holding
  two stocks in one tier is never stranded (sell either, then it reopens);
- the three RPC slot guards (slot on a sell, a foreign slot, a slot-less buy in a slotted
  league) are `bad_request` and write nothing, and run AFTER the CAS;
- a slot deleted between the guard reads and the INSERT (a test trigger simulates the
  commissioner's lock-free DELETE) maps the FK error to `ledger_changed`, nothing written;
- the table: `slot_id` buy-only CHECK, deleted slot is SET NULL;
- both HUMAN ACTION effect-check DO blocks run verbatim: the #113 block against the
  13-arg function, and the new `TIER_TRADE_SLOTS EFFECT TEST` block, which must PASS,
  read PARTIAL (never PASS) when no completed slotted league exists, and FAIL (writing
  nothing) for each of: a removed guard (x3), EXECUTE leaked to authenticated, the
  12-arg overload left callable.

Mutation-checked: reverting the validator's occupancy to drafts-only fails 7 hermetic
tests including the repro (`draft-validation.test.ts`, "tier trades: ...").

## freeze_league_rules.pglite.test.ts

What it does:
- Loads, **verbatim** and in prod order:
  - the `drafts` RLS (`20251205110000`, including the live "Commissioners can delete
    picks" policy) and its INSERT-policy drop (`20260811000003`);
  - the B1 helpers and the `leagues` / `league_members` RLS (`20260712000000`/`01`/`02`,
    including [I5] delete-self);
  - `league_draft_slots` with its interim commissioner policies (`20260810000004`);
  - the F1 member column guard (`20260925000000`) and the pick clock (`20261010000000`);
  - the `playoff_teams` freeze (`20261012000002`) and draft order modes
    (`20261013000000`);
  - then `20261104000000_freeze_league_rules_after_draft_start`.

  So every prod trigger on `leagues` and `league_members` fires here, in prod's order.
- Builds `leagues` by **replaying every `CREATE TABLE` / `ALTER TABLE … ADD|DROP|RENAME
  COLUMN` on it** from `supabase/migrations/` (FK `REFERENCES` stripped). The triggers
  therefore run against the real column set, types and inline CHECKs.
- Runs writes as `authenticated` with a JWT sub, so the real interim policies admit the
  commissioner and the new triggers are what refuse them. The service role is
  `service_role` (bypassrls) with no sub.

It covers:
- **replay completeness**: every migration statement that mentions `table leagues` is
  either replayed or a known non-column form (constraints, RLS, column defaults). An
  `ADD x` without `COLUMN`, a quoted name, or DDL inside a `DO` block fails the test, so
  the replay can't silently miss a column.
- **classification**: every `leagues` column is classified as `frozen`, `stamp_once`,
  `guarded` (with the named trigger) or deliberately `editable`. **A new column fails
  this test until it is classified**, so a future rule column cannot silently stay
  commissioner-writable. The editable set is exercised post-draft, and `id` is pinned.
- the season-state columns (`season_status`, `current_week`, `current_season_id`,
  `commissioner_id`) and the retired `budget_mode` frozen like the rules; `league_start_date` / `league_end_date`
  stamp-once, exactly F1's carve-out: NULL → value only in the completing UPDATE
  (`in_progress` → `completed`). The member and commissioner completion shapes pass. A
  rewrite, a clear, or a hindsight stamp at any other time is refused.
- the "guarded elsewhere" columns are proven post-draft: `draft_order_mode` and
  `pick_seconds` are refused, and `pick_clock_enabled` / `draft_started_at` are reverted
- no probing: a non-commissioner writing a slot into someone else's league gets the RLS
  error, not `league_slots_locked`. The DEFINER trigger only reads and locks the caller's
  own leagues.
- leaving the league ([I5], interim guard): a member and the commissioner refused with
  `league_membership_locked` in `in_progress` and `completed`; pre-draft leave unchanged;
  the service role may remove a member post-draft, but mid-draft it still meets the
  older all-roles `draft_in_progress`; deleting a started league cascades its members,
  slots and draft order; two leaves in one transaction complete (single connection only).
  The lock MODES (`FOR NO KEY UPDATE` for leaves, `FOR SHARE` scoped to the caller's
  leagues for slots) are pinned statically from `pg_proc.prosrc`, because one connection
  can't tell them apart.
- draft picks: the commissioner's pick DELETE is refused in `in_progress` and `completed`
  (`draft_picks_locked`). A pre-draft delete is allowed. A member's delete and any user
  UPDATE match 0 rows (there are no such policies). The service role may delete, and
  deleting a started league cascades its picks.
- pre-draft: the commissioner inserts, updates and deletes slots and edits every rule
- `in_progress` and `completed`: every slot write (and the delete-then-insert client
  save) refused with `league_slots_locked`; each of the 14 frozen columns refused on
  its own (and set to NULL) with `league_rules_locked` naming the column; nothing written
- the same-value patch shapes of mobile `league-settings.tsx` and web `Leagues.jsx`
  (with an unscaled `budget_amount`) still saving after the draft
- one UPDATE that changes a rule and starts the draft (judged on OLD, allowed)
- the `draft_status` transition table: the three forward moves, every backward move
  refused for the commissioner (`league_draft_status_locked`) but allowed for the
  service role, and the rewind bypass closed end to end
- re-parenting a slot into or out of a started league; the commissioner deleting a
  completed league (the slot cascade); a member still refused by RLS
- the lock: a slot write row-locks its league (`xmax`), and both same-transaction
  orders complete. Two-transaction races need two connections, so that argument is in
  the migration header.
- fail closed: an unknown or NULL `draft_status` (with the CHECK dropped) freezes
  everything and allows no move
- `proacl`, `prosecdef` and the `search_path` pin of both trigger functions
- (the human post-push block `docs/security/freeze-league-rules-effect-test.sql` moved to
  `freeze_league_rules_later_guards.pglite.test.ts` below: it now covers the chain through
  `20261111000001`, which this suite does not load)

## freeze_league_rules_later_guards.pglite.test.ts

The guards that came AFTER the freeze (`20261104000000`) and act on the same tables, on the
**full** chain (`freeze_harness.ts` holds the schema, the `leagues` column replay and
`CLASSIFICATION`, shared with the suite above). It loads, verbatim and in prod order, the
freeze chain plus `20261004000000`, `20261101000001`, `20261107000000`, `20261107000004`,
`20261107000006`, `20261110000000`/`01`/`02` and `20261111000000`/`01`, then:

- runs the human post-push block `docs/security/freeze-league-rules-effect-test.sql`
  **verbatim**: every line PASS, the file's EXPECTED OUTPUT header lists exactly the lines
  it prints, its `c_classified` list equals `CLASSIFICATION`, and nothing persists. It covers
  the reconfirm gate (W), commissioner-via-transfer (T), draft_status server-only (X, R7, D1),
  the insert guard (I), the draft-time guard (H: invalid, too soon, locked, postponed, the
  legacy same-value patch, INSERT), the dropped delete-self policy (L) and the later
  functions' grants (G3, G4). It had stopped at `20261104000000`, so six of its lines
  described replaced rules (hygiene pre-1.3).
- for EACH guard, a **bad case**: a fresh database with that one guard removed (a trigger
  dropped, rule (1) cut from the freeze function, the `[I5]` policy restored, a function
  re-granted or losing its `search_path`), and the guard's own lines must FAIL while every
  other line still PASSES (each refused-write case has its own fixture league, so a missing
  guard cannot change the fixtures under the lines after it)

**PR #94 (Run it back) pointer.** On `origin/feat/run-it-back` (not on `main` when this
test was written), `renew_league` and `start_renewed_season` write slots and rules with
the commissioner's JWT, so this freeze applies to them. Both touch only `not_started`
leagues, so they pass as written. When #94 lands, add a step here that runs them against
this trigger. #94 also adds `leagues` columns (`previous_league_id`, `lineage_id`,
`season_number`), so on rebase this test FAILS until they are classified. They are
guarded by #94's own `enforce_league_lineage_columns` trigger.

Mutation-checked: 25 mutations, 23 of which fail at least one step. They cover:
- each guard branch;
- the leave guard disabled, its cascade allowance removed, its service-role exemption
  removed, and its lock swapped to `FOR SHARE`;
- the drafts guard disabled, its cascade allowance removed, and its scope removed;
- the slot trigger's commissioner scope removed;
- a state column dropped, and `budget_mode` dropped;
- stamp-once refusing NULL → value, and stamp-once widened back to any time;
- three probe migrations: an unclassified column, an `ADD` without `COLUMN`, and an
  `ADD COLUMN` inside a `DO` block.

The two survivors are equivalent, not gaps. They remove the slot and drafts triggers'
explicit `auth.uid() IS NULL` exemption, which changes nothing: their commissioner scope
(`commissioner_id = auth.uid()::text`) already matches no league when the uid is NULL.

#94 compatibility was checked once, in a scratch copy of this suite, against
`20261115000004_run_it_back_gate.sql` @ `f450e78`, all passing:
- the renewal self-leave while `not_started` is allowed and its sync sets the reply to `out`;
- the gate's `num_participants` rewrite on the start UPDATE is allowed (judged on OLD);
- after the start, the freeze and the leave guard hold.

Make that a committed step when #94 lands.

## leave_league.pglite.test.ts

What it does:
- Loads the leave-league migrations `20261107000000`–`06` **verbatim**. Underneath them, also verbatim, are the real objects they meet in prod:
  - PR #9's leagues column guard;
  - the pick clock;
  - flexible playoffs;
  - the draft-order chain `20261013000000`, whose member trigger closes the order gap on a leave;
  - the display-name and Home RPCs, with the ranking they read;
  - `join_league_by_code`, for the rejoin case.
- Simulates Supabase's default API-role grants, so the `proacl` assertions prove the explicit revokes work.
- Runs `docs/security/leave-league-effect-test.sql`, the prod effect check, and requires all 25 lines to PASS and the fixture to roll back.

It covers:
- the leave window:
  - random mode before the reveal;
  - an open manual order;
  - inside the hour, by time;
  - a finalized order with `draft_date` moved later, by state;
  - mid-draft and mid-season;
  - a TBD date;
- refusals writing nothing;
- the reconfirm row across two leaves and a rejoin;
- `confirm_league_roster` with P above, at and below the member count;
- the commissioner hand-over and the successor refusals;
- `sole_manager`;
- hide/unhide plus `get_home_summary` skipping hidden leagues (ACL byte-identical);
- `[I5]` gone (a client DELETE removes nothing).
- the board's reconfirmation:
  - "Invite someone new" is cleared by a HUMAN join through `join_league_by_code`, never by a bot, never on a pending row, and never while P > members;
  - a new departure re-opens the choice;
  - a repeat leave sends no second notice;
- the draft order WAITING past T−1h while a reconfirmation is owed, and set the moment it clears (on confirm, or on an invite cleared by a join);
- the start gate binding the commissioner's raw flip and the service role;
- `draft_order_notify_due` ignoring stranded `member_left` rows.
- Q4 = A (`20261110000000`–`02`):
  - the commissioner is always refused `transfer_first`;
  - `transfer_commissioner`'s who/whom/when refusals (the locked middle; both open windows);
  - the post-season transfer on the service path with #123 loaded;
  - a user session can never write `commissioner_id` directly;
  - transfer then leave;
  - a transfer while a confirmation is owed;
  - the renewal transfer: the old commissioner leaves as an invitee.

The second `Deno.test` boots a fresh database with `fixtures/run_it_back_398da84_membership.sql`, a verbatim copy of PR #94's renewal response table and its `trg_league_members_renewal_sync_delete`. It proves three things:
- an invitee's leave is an `out` reply with no reconfirm row;
- a newcomer's leave writes one;
- the renewal commissioner is refused.

**When #94 merges, delete the fixture and load #94's migrations instead.**

Run: `deno test --allow-read --allow-env supabase/tests/leave_league.pglite.test.ts`

## leaver_gaps.pglite.test.ts

After the season, leaving sets `league_members.hidden_at` and keeps the row. This covers the two places that treated a leaver as a current member, or let a row be born hidden:
- `20261120000000`: `transfer_commissioner` refuses a hidden target with `target_invalid` (and writes nothing), still transfers to a current member in both open windows, and transfers again once the leaver un-hides. Grants are checked by `proacl` and `has_function_privilege`.
- `20261120000001`: `league_members_insert_self` refuses a self-insert with `hidden_at` set (42501). The normal create-league insert (omitted or explicit-NULL `hidden_at`) still works, and the policy's three older conditions still refuse on their own.

What it does:
- Boots the leave-league replica and migration chain, verbatim. The one difference: `league_members`' policies are the REAL chain (`20260712000002` → `20260811000005` → `20261001000000`), not hand-declared stand-ins.
- A BEFORE step reproduces both findings on the pre-fix definitions.
- Runs `docs/security/leaver-gaps-effect-test.sql`, the prod effect check, and requires its 6 PASS lines and a rolled-back fixture. Line I1 is INFO: it reports the `[I6]` bot-insert residual (a bot row can still be born hidden until `[I6]` is dropped).
- Independent of #205 (`20261119*`).

Run: `deno test --allow-read --allow-env supabase/tests/leaver_gaps.pglite.test.ts`

## migration_cli_split.test.ts

What it does:
- Ports the Supabase CLI's statement splitter (`pkg/parser/state.go`, v2.67.1) to
  TypeScript, faithfully, quirks included, and runs it over every file in
  `supabase/migrations/` and `deferred/`.
- A file passes when the splitter ends at rest (ready, or in a trailing line
  comment). Ending inside an ATOMIC block, a quote, a dollar quote or a block
  comment means `supabase db push` would glue statements into one and Postgres
  would refuse it (42601).

Why: PGlite runs multi-statement text directly, so the PGlite suites can't see
the CLI's splitting. On 2026-10-06 the first push of `20261102000000` failed
because the bare name `record_trade_atomic` contains "atomic", which the splitter
reads as `BEGIN ATOMIC`. Fix: quote the identifier (`public."my_atomic_fn"`).

Run: `deno test --allow-read supabase/tests/migration_cli_split.test.ts` (files only).

## run_it_back.pglite.test.ts

What it does:
- Loads the six `*_run_it_back_*.sql` migrations (20261115000000-05) **verbatim**,
  found by suffix and applied in name order, so a re-stamp needs no edit here.
  Also loads `is_member` (20260712000000), `participant_display_name` (20261004000000)
  and the `league_notifications` table DDL (20261013000000) by slicing.
- Simulates Supabase's default EXECUTE grants, so every grant assertion proves the
  explicit revokes work.

It covers, in one ordered flow on one league:
- grants: client RPCs authenticated-only; helpers and triggers closed; the table
  closed to every API role except a SELECT for service_role (draft-control's count);
- identity: anon refused by the grant; a player refused as non-commissioner;
- `renew_league`: fresh code, cap 16, old season byte-identical, each human member
  invited once, the bot excluded, and a second tap returns the same season;
- the gate: `draft_date`, `draft_status` and `draft_order_mode` refused while a reply
  is pending, including as service_role;
- replies: commissioner-cannot-opt-out, strangers, a bad value; the notice counts;
  the free in/out/in flip; `unchanged` on a repeat;
- a pending player sees only their own status; a stranger sees nothing;
- nudge: once per 24 h, status never changes;
- remove: pending to out, decided by the commissioner, final for the player;
- the table guard, for every role: nothing returns to pending; removed is final;
  the commissioner cannot be out; inserts are pending-only (the commissioner's own
  'in' row excepted);
- the review: unknown keys, bad slots and a missing date refused before any write;
  settings and slots applied; `season_set` once per member (not the commissioner, not
  the removed);
- a newcomer joins; the draft start sets `num_participants` to the member count;
- after the start: replies, removals and the review refused;
- the roster: full list for members, counts, the commissioner's actions;
- history: a newcomer reads Season 1 standings and week-by-week matchups; a stranger
  reads nothing; a removed Season 1 member keeps Season 1;
- `set_draft_order` refused while a reply is pending;
- cancel: the new season and its rows vanish; the predecessor renews again;
- `finalize_league_draft` numbers the season from `leagues.season_number` (3, not 1);
- `get_home_summary`: the lineage columns exist; its ACL is re-applied after the DROP.

NOT covered here (their own suites or still open):
- the draft-order triggers and meta tables (not loaded): "the order locks" and the
  leave/join append rules under renewal;
- the PR #9 member column guard (not loaded), so the trigger-order claim is untested;
- `join_league_by_code`'s `league_full` cap for newcomers (not loaded);
- races are sequential: the FOR UPDATE locks are structural, not exercised in parallel.
## autopick_cron_wiring.test.ts, autopick_cron_predicate.pglite.test.ts

The auto-pick cron (`20261106000000`) cannot run in PGlite (`pg_cron`, `pg_net` and `vault` do not exist
there), so two tests cover what a header comment cannot enforce.
- `autopick_cron_wiring.test.ts` (hermetic, `--allow-read` only): schedule and cadence, vault key with no key
  literal, explicit `timeout_milliseconds := 180000`, the stall throttle window equals `STALL_COOLDOWN_MS`
  and does not throttle `vendor_outage`, the purge job is plain SQL, the stamps are in order, nothing is left
  in `deferred/`.
- `autopick_cron_predicate.pglite.test.ts`: slices the cron's actual `where exists (...)` out of the migration and
  executes it against a stubbed `overdue_draft_turns()` and a `draft_stalls` replica (11 cases).

## refuse_new_skip.pglite.test.ts

Loads `20261106000002` verbatim onto a `drafts` table that already holds legacy SKIP rows: SKIP/skip INSERT and an
UPDATE-to-SKIP are refused with `23514`, normal picks insert, legacy rows stay readable and editable on other
columns, and the function is not executable by anon/authenticated.

## autopick_runbook_sql.pglite.test.ts

Runs `docs/security/autopick-live-test-proof.sql` and `docs/security/refuse-new-skip-effect-test.sql` **verbatim**
(the SQL-editor scripts of `docs/migrations/AUTOPICK_CRON_LIVE.md`): PASS on a good fixture, then one mutation per
check must flip exactly its own line to FAIL, and each script must leave nothing behind.
## cron_timeouts.pglite.test.ts

What it does:
- Stubs `cron.job` / `cron.schedule` / `cron.unschedule` (pg_cron semantics: upsert by
  name) and seeds the live rows from `docs/architecture/db-snapshot.json` plus the two
  heal-cron migrations that postdate it.
- Runs `20261108000000_cron_explicit_timeouts.sql` over them and asserts every job keeps
  its schedule and its command (modulo the timeout), gains `timeout_milliseconds :=
  180000`, and is not duplicated; the key still comes from the vault.
- Proves the migration is ONE statement (run through `db.query`, which refuses more
  than one command, as the CLI's per-statement sends do), that a failure mid-sequence
  rolls every job back, and that its pre-flight aborts, changing nothing, when a job is
  missing, on another schedule, or paused.
- Loads the prior `schedule_snapshot_retry` verbatim, then `20261108000001`, and shows the
  generated one-shot jobs gain the timeout while `search_path`, `SECURITY DEFINER` and
  the 'retrying' write are unchanged.
- GUARD: replays every `supabase/migrations/*.sql` (not `deferred/`) and fails any cron
  still scheduled without a timeout above 150 s. Jobs unscheduled and never rescheduled
  are ignored; the guard is itself tested on synthetic input.

Re-run it against the next `db-snapshot.json` re-capture: a live command that differs
from the migration's (timeout aside) fails the "same command" test.

## cron_status_handlers.test.ts

Drives the REAL `index.ts` of process-week-results, snapshot-week-start/-end and
refresh-market-calendar (Deno.serve captured, `fetch` replaced by an in-memory PostgREST)
through each exit, and asserts the `cron_job_status` writes: one `running`, one terminal,
the same-day no-op rule (a heal never erases earlier work or a failure), and that a
rejected status write cannot change the HTTP response. Hermetic (no network, no DB):
`deno test --allow-read --allow-env supabase/tests/cron_status_handlers.test.ts`.
## draft_auto_start.pglite.test.ts

What it does: loads, verbatim and in prod order, every migration whose triggers
fire on a `leagues` / `league_members` / `league_notifications` write (the freeze
test's chain, plus `draft_stalls`, participant names, and #126's reconfirm table +
real start gate), then `20261111000000` (auto-start) and `20261111000001`
(`draft_status` server-only + the draft-time guard). The chain is loaded in two
halves around legacy fixtures, so the one-off backfills run on real rows.
`leagues` is replayed from the migrations' DDL, so the compare-and-swap is judged
against real column types; the expectation is built by the real
`buildStartExpect`. Every case sets `draft_date` relative to `now()`, so the
gate / room / reminder windows run for real.

It covers (Giorgio's decisions, 2026-10-06):
- the one-off backfills: past `not_started` leagues postponed silently (`legacy`,
  no notices, date untouched); #67's undelivered `draft_order_set` pushes settled
- grants (service_role only) / security mode / `search_path` for every function;
  both state tables RLS-on and service_role SELECT-only; the lock clauses
  (start + postpone `FOR UPDATE`, the watch `FOR SHARE`); the postponement row
  written before the date is cleared
- the policy pin: SQL `draft_start_policy()` = TS `SQL_POLICY`
- the kind CHECK union (+ #67, #94, #126); `draft_order_set` is in-app only
- the watch: no verdict, a join or settings edit, stale inside 24 h only; the
  commissioner warned ONCE per blocked episode, the T-2h reminder once (a first
  warning inside T-2h counts as it); unknown keeps the verdict; CAS + staleness
- the gate: clear clears it; unknown only at the room time; blocked postpones
  (date cleared, watch gone, every human told, bots skipped, #67 not finalized)
- rooms: `open_due_draft_rooms` finalizes + one notice per human, idempotent,
  late joiners, never without a cleared gate
- the start: postponed leagues never due; the room must have opened; the floor;
  CAS; started (order locked, clock anchored, `draft_started` per human);
  idempotent; #126's REAL gate and a #94 stand-in are `blocked`, others re-raise
- `draft_notice_context`; the draft-time guard (quarter hours, 55 min, locked once
  the room opens, postponed and legacy-postponed allowed, the reschedule trigger
  clears the postponement, INSERT judged, service role exempt, started inert)
- server-only `draft_status` (UPDATE + INSERT); clients denied everything
- both cron guards, sliced from the LATEST schedules and executed
- `docs/security/draft-auto-start-effect-test.sql`, verbatim, rolled back

Negative controls (run 2026-10-06, each made the named steps fail): CAS off; the
gate lead changed; no room check at start; warn on every blocked verdict; a
postponement that keeps the date; `draft_order_set` pushes not skipped; no
room-open lock on the time; no quarter-hour rule; rooms ignoring the gate; no
legacy backfill; the sweep without the watch guard; server-only off; the
reschedule trigger keeping the postponement; the gate catching every 22023;
postponement notices to bots. Round 2 (after both reviews): finalize ignoring the
gate; finalize ignoring a postponement; no gate hand-back; postpone without CAS;
no at-risk flap guard; no postponed-push cooldown; the cron guard not isolated;
the legacy date kept; the watch without urgency ordering; time-set without the
debounce re-stamp, skipping the person who made the change, telling bots; the reminder sharing the
at-risk kind.

Run: `deno test --allow-read --allow-env supabase/tests/draft_auto_start.pglite.test.ts`.

## draft_auto_start_cron_wiring.test.ts

A structural guard (files only). The auto-pick cron (`20261106000000`) and the
auto-start reschedule (`20261111000002`) both re-schedule `draft_autopick_sweep`,
and the last one applied wins. So the LATEST migration scheduling the job must
guard on `overdue_draft_turns()`, `due_draft_starts()` and `draft_watch_due()`,
and both files must be present with the auto-start one sorting after the
auto-pick one. It also pins the job contract (10 s, vault key, 180000 ms, URL, no
key literal, no other job), and that `draft_order_notify` is promoted: scheduled
once (`20261111000003`), guarded by `draft_order_notify_due() OR
draft_room_notices_due()`, 180000 ms, gone from `deferred/`.

Run: `deno test --allow-read supabase/tests/draft_auto_start_cron_wiring.test.ts`.

## draft_control_status_wiring.test.ts

A structural guard (files only). draft-control `status` returns `server_now`
(the mobile lobby's clock offset), taken ONCE from the DB clock
(`get_draft_clock.server_now`, edge clock as fallback) and used to judge
`start_state`, so both describe the same instant. `resolveServerNow` itself is
unit-tested in `functions/_shared/draft-start-policy.test.ts`. Also: starting a
draft never sends a turn push (#160's `notifyNextPicker` follows recorded picks
only). The start path imports no push code, and `start_league_draft` writes only
`draft_started` notices, so the first picker hears "You pick 1st" once.

Run: `deno test --allow-read supabase/tests/draft_control_status_wiring.test.ts`.

## arch_call_sites.test.ts

What it does:
- Runs `scripts/arch-call-sites.mjs` (the architecture map's wrapper attribution and
  blind-spot report) over fixtures in `fixtures/arch-seam/`: real seam files copied from
  `origin/ui/mobile-league-setup` @ 572ada6 (`seamCalls.ts`, `categoryData.ts`,
  `RenewalRoster.tsx`, `useAllMatchups.ts`, `useDraftRoom.ts`, `QueueEditor.tsx`), minimal
  skeletons that keep the real call lines (`league.tsx`, `createLeague.tsx`), and synthetic
  edge cases (dynamic and templated names, a wrapper used as a value, a same-named function
  from another module, a pure helper that takes a callback).
- Pins that wrappers are found from their definitions (no list of names), that a caller's
  name argument is parsed like a direct call, that a ternary of literals is INFERRED, that a
  callback wrapper's first argument (a fixture key) is never minted into a table, and that
  everything unattributable is REPORTED.
- INVARIANT: every call of a wrapper is attributed or reported, never silently dropped.
- Wiring: the generator hashes the blind spots and qualifies `--check`'s "current".

Hermetic: `deno test --allow-read supabase/tests/arch_call_sites.test.ts`.

## send_notification_types.test.ts

Drives the REAL `send-notification/index.ts` (Deno.serve captured, `fetch` replaced by a
fake Supabase: an authenticated caller, an allowing rate limit) and pins that `draft_turn`,
removed from the closed set on 2026-10-06, is refused exactly like an unknown type (400
`unknown notification type`) before any membership, league or push-token read. The turn
push is server-side now (`_shared/draft-write.ts` notifyNextPicker), and a callerless
entry would be a "your turn" spam template any leaguemate could fire. Hermetic:
`deno test --allow-read --allow-env supabase/tests/send_notification_types.test.ts`.

## social_signup.pglite.test.ts

Onboarding W2 (plan 2026-10-14): Sign in with Apple / Google meets the two server pieces every
new account passes. Loads `20260815000000_signup_gate` (`restrict_new_signups`) and
`20261005000001_signup_username_trigger` (`handle_new_user_profile`) verbatim; neither has been
redefined since.
- Apple- and Google-shaped `raw_user_meta_data` (provider claims, no `username` key, even a
  username-shaped `given_name`) and an email sign-up without a username all get a profile row
  with a NULL username, which is what puts the app's pick-username gate in front.
- The hook, called with the event GoTrue builds for an external signup (its id_token grant runs
  the Before User Created hook when it is about to create a user: `internal/api/token_oidc.go`),

## draft_room_reads.pglite.test.ts

The draft room's reads before the start (plan `docs/plans/2026-11-10-pre-draft-room.md`, W2), on the
whole migration chain (`full_chain.ts`). The room becomes a route from T−1h, so each read
`lib/game/useDraftRoom.ts` makes (`get_draft_clock`, `get_draft_order`, `drafts`,
`get_league_display_names`, `draft_queue`) must answer a member who is not the commissioner before
the draft starts. It proves:
- before T−1h, in the room window before the gate clears, and once the order is set, every read
  answers the member with a clean waiting shape (clock not running, no deadline, zero picks), never
  an error;
- a random order is not on the server before the gate clears: `get_draft_order` returns
  `order: null` and `league_draft_order` has no rows. Once the gate clears, the member's read sets it
  (the lazy reveal) with one entry per member;
- a member reads only their own queue;
- a signed-in non-member is refused by every read, and anon cannot execute the three RPCs (proacl:
  no anon, no PUBLIC);
- pinned as a product question, not a bug: a manual-order league's members can read the
  commissioner's open order before T−1h.

Mutants it catches: anon granted execute on `get_draft_order`; the gate clause removed from
`_draft_order_sync` (the order then appears before the gate has judged the league).
