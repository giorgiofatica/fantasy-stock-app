/**
 * Draft auto-start POLICY. Pure: no DB, no Deno runtime APIs (hermetically
 * tested in draft-start-policy.test.ts; mobile can import the same rules).
 *
 * Giorgio, 2026-10-06: "the draft is not something that is started manually.
 * It should be something that starts at the minute that is selected by the
 * commissioner ... the draft room will open at 11 a.m. and the draft will
 * automatically start at noon."
 * Decisions (2026-10-06): "people still need an hour heads up and notice".
 *   1. The REAL GATE is room-open time (T-1h). Blocked then: the room does not
 *      open, the draft does not start, the league is POSTPONED, everyone is
 *      told, and the commissioner picks a NEW time (>= 1 h notice again). No
 *      late start. Blocked at T even though the room opened (rare): the same.
 *   2. The commissioner is warned BEFORE the room opens: the moment the league
 *      becomes blocked, and again at T-2h if still blocked.
 *   3. Pushes to everyone: the room opens (with your position), the draft
 *      started, and the draft is postponed.
 *   4. Draft times: quarter hours only, at least an hour ahead (55 min floor).
 *   5. The time can't change once the room is open, except when postponed.
 *
 * SQL holds the same numbers in public.draft_start_policy() (20261111000000);
 * supabase/tests/draft_auto_start.pglite.test.ts pins the two equal.
