/**
 * The draft pick clock's server AUTO-PICK (product rules, Giorgio 2026-09-29):
 * when a manager's clock runs out the server picks for them — first their own
 * draft QUEUE, in order, the first still-legal symbol; then BEST AVAILABLE,
 * like fantasy football: walk the market by size (largest market cap first)
 * and take the first stock that fits the league's rules. Never random. A stall
 * only when nothing is legal.
 *
 * ACCEPTANCE CRITERION (Giorgio): auto-draft must NEVER give someone a stock
 * their league's rules forbid. Enforced structurally, not by care:
 *   * every candidate — queue or best available, human or bot — is judged by
 *     ./pick-gate.ts `gatePick`, i.e. the SAME validatePick a manual pick
 *     passes, fed the LIVE fill price and the symbol's category eligibility;
 *   * chooseAutoPick can only return a pick as a `GatedPick`, which only
 *     gatePick can produce, and the writer (draft-write.ts insertGatedPick)
 *     accepts nothing else. Cheap cached-price filters here only decide WHAT
 *     TO TRY — never what is legal.
 *
 * SEARCH DEPTH ("a legal pick is found whenever one exists"): best available
 * is not a fixed top-N list. Each round asks the database
 * (public.auto_pick_search_candidates, one call per OPEN slot) for the
 * largest stocks that fit that slot's price bracket (clamped to the remaining
 * budget), its category, the draftable universe, and are not owned or already
 * judged. The search WALKS THE WHOLE POOL page by page (2026-10-05 liveness):
 * no top-N window, so a stock outside the top by market cap IS found when it is
 * the only fit. Each candidate is judged free at its cached price, then live.
 *
 *   QUEUE_MAX_ATTEMPTS  = 5    live-priced queue candidates (the user's preference list)
 *   LIVE_MAX_ATTEMPTS   = 20   live fill calls per auto-pick (a quota bound)
 *   SCREEN_MAX_REQUESTS = 5    batched snapshot requests per auto-pick (100 symbols each)
 *   FRESH_MS            = 30m  a cached price written from a live price this recently
 *                              IS a live price: judged on it, never re-priced
 *
 * NEVER STALLS ON A STALE CACHE (Giorgio, 2026-10-13: after a clock expires ONLY
 * the auto-pick fills the turn, so "the auto pick has to work"): a candidate the
 * cached price refuses, but a live price could admit (within NEAR_MISS_MARGIN of
 * an open bracket or the budget top, or refused only by the budget reserve), is
 * priced live through a batched SCREEN before it is ever counted as refused; and
 * when the first search finds nothing, a second, wider search runs. See
 * chooseAutoPick.
 *
 * NO SKIP (2026-10-05, "a draft pick can never be unused"): when the whole pool
 * is walked with nothing legal the choice is 'stalled' — no row is written, the
 * turn stays open, the failure is recorded and alerted (draft-write.ts). A
 * vendor outage, or a bound, is 'retry_later'. See chooseAutoPick and decideNoPick.
 *
 * PROGRESS ACROSS TICKS (2026-10-13, review H1): every live price (screen or fill)
 * is written back with its time; a cached price younger than FRESH_MS is judged
 * as live (refused for free, never re-priced). So a search that stops on a bound
 * resumes past what it judged, and a true stall reaches 'stalled' in a few ticks
 * instead of re-pricing the same fringe forever. A bounded result is recorded and
 * recorded by draft-write.ts (boundedReportsStalled, stallCooldownVerdict).
 *
 * THE DEADLINE IS NOT COMPUTED HERE. It has exactly one definition —
 * public.get_draft_clock — which clients, the edge gate and the cron's
 * overdue filter all read, on the DATABASE clock. decideAutoPickGate only
 * interprets that function's row.
 *
 * I/O is injected (AutoPickPorts), so the whole search — including the
 * "never illegal, never a needless skip" property — is unit-tested against an
 * in-memory market in auto-pick.test.ts. draft-write.ts supplies the real
 * ports (Supabase + Alpaca) and does the write.

 *      no price could change (category, would strand another manager at every slot
 *      its price could reach) costs nothing and is final for this call;
 *   2. if it passes, priced LIVE (one fill call). The live gate decides. The live
 *      price is written back to the cache, so a candidate refused live drops out of
 *      step 1 on every later call and the walk progresses across ticks;
 *   3. if it was refused at its cached price for a reason a LIVE price could change
 *      (2026-10-13, "the auto pick has to work"): the budget reserve, or a cached
 *      price outside an open window but within NEAR_MISS_MARGIN of it; or it has no
 *      cached price: it is SCREENED. One batched snapshot request prices a whole
 *      page of these; a screen price the gate refuses settles it for free, one the
 *      gate accepts (or no screen price) goes to step 2's fill call.
 * Two searches: the first with SEARCH_MARGINS (brackets +-10%, budget exact); if it
 * finds nothing legal, the NEAR-MISS search (every window widened by
 * NEAR_MISS_MARGIN, the budget top too) walks what the first did not judge.
 * 'stalled' means: both searches walked the whole pool, nothing passed the gate, and
 * no candidate was lost to a vendor outage. A vendor outage on a candidate that would
 * have gone live, or the live-call bound, is 'retry_later'. Residual: a legal stock
 * whose cached price is more than NEAR_MISS_MARGIN outside every open window is found
 * once its cache refreshes.
 *
 * Feasibility: the pool and the league's open demand are read once. Each open
 * slot's search is capped at the reserve left after filling it (a necessary
 * condition, so no legal stock is hidden).
 *
 * Throws if a port throws (a failed read must not look like "nothing legal").
