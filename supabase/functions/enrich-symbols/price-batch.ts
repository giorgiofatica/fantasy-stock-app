/**
 * enrich-symbols price-batch — pure symbol filtering + Alpaca batch-bisection
 * logic, plus the batch-selection merge. Extracted for hermetic testing, same
 * pattern as ../snapshot-week-start/plan.ts: no DB, no Alpaca, no Deno
 * runtime APIs. Run from repo root with
 *   deno test supabase/functions/enrich-symbols/price-batch.test.ts
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS (found 2026-09-25 by the live test draft; see
 * docs/STATUS.md §4 and CLAUDE.md "success signals are unreliable" #7):
 * Alpaca's `/v2/stocks/snapshots` multi-symbol endpoint is all-or-nothing —
 * Alpaca staff confirm it "returns either an error (e.g. if a symbol is
 * invalid) or the requested data... never both." One malformed symbol
 * anywhere in a 50-symbol batch 400s the WHOLE request, so up to 49 good
 * prices were silently dropped alongside 1 bad one, and the batch still
 * reported `ok:true, priced:0` — a false success, the exact shape CLAUDE.md
 * warns about.
 *
 * TWO INDEPENDENT DEFENSES, both needed:
 *   1. partitionForAlpaca — a pure PRE-FILTER that keeps symbols Alpaca's
 *      us_equity universe structurally does not list (preferred stock /
 *      warrant / unit / rights / when-issued forms from NASDAQ Trader's
 *      otherlisted/nasdaqlisted feeds, e.g. `$`/`-`/`=`/`^`/digit suffixes)
 *      out of the request entirely. Class shares (NASDAQ Trader's own dot
 *      notation, e.g. BRK.B) pass through unchanged — Alpaca accepts that
 *      form as-is, so no translation step exists here on purpose.
 *   2. fetchPricesBisecting — CONTAINMENT for anything that slips past the
 *      filter and still 400s (e.g. a symbol quietly delisted from Alpaca's
 *      universe but still well-formed and `active=true` in ours): halve the
 *      chunk and retry, down to singles, so one bad symbol costs only
 *      itself. Bounded by MAX_ALPACA_REQUESTS so a pathological
 *      multi-bad-symbol batch cannot burn Alpaca's whole 200-req/min
 *      Basic-plan budget, which quote/ticker-quotes/historical-bars also
 *      share.
