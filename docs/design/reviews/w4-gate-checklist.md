# W4 gate checklist · the Game Night screens (Design Lead, 2026-10-12)

The gate every W4 screen branch passes before the Design Lead replies `DESIGN-APPROVED`
(plan `docs/plans/2026-10-12-visual-language-reset.md`, W4). It **adds to** the gate in
[`../UI-UX-PROGRAM.md`](../UI-UX-PROGRAM.md) ("Design review gate": specificity, squint,
scorecard, persona walk, P0–P3 with drift classes, the `ux-reviewer` table, §9B, block
rhythm); it replaces nothing there. Workers: read it before turn 1, so the captures you hand
back are the ones the gate needs.

**The authority for every value:** DESIGN_DIRECTION §9C (Game Night, both themes) and the
board section `#call-game-night`. The rules that bind every screen: PRODUCT_RULES
("Captivating, not bland", "Every section must elevate", "Both themes, designed together",
"Direction chosen: Game Night", "No sparklines on rows", "Nothing tappable does nothing") and
the calm-Home structure.

## Order (one gate each; at most two screen workers at once)

1. **Home** (in season, pre-draft, post-season).
2. **Matchup** (live, final, the reveal), with **the player card**.
3. **Draft room** and the lobby.
4. **League** (Standings, Schedule, Playoffs, History).
5. **Portfolio**, the stock sheet / player card from Portfolio, and Buy a stock (search).
6. **Onboarding, invite, join.**
7. **The watchlist and claims surfaces**, when their plan builds them.

Nothing ships to TestFlight until every screen is on Game Night in both themes
(PRODUCT_RULES: "no screen mixes skins").

## 1. The capture set (incomplete without all of it)

- **Both themes, every capture.** A capture set with one theme fails the gate before review
  ("a screen is not approved in one theme without the other").
- **Devices:** the 17e and the 17 Pro, Large text. XL (`accessibility-extra-large`) on the
  screen's busiest state. Reduce Motion on the screen's main motion.
- **AX5 (`accessibility-extra-extra-extra-large`) on every gate** (2026-11-02): it is the size
  Giorgio's phone runs, and both of his large-text bugs were only visible there. The repo's
  "XXXL" (`extra-extra-extra-large`) is the largest STANDARD size, not his; a gate at XXXL alone
  can pass while the new code never runs (a wrap, a stack or a shrink that only AX5 triggers).
- **Live text-size changes** (2026-11-02/03): change the size with the screen open, L→AX5 and
  AX5→L, and diff against a cold launch at the same size and scroll. 0 px is the bar (pulsing
  dots and the caret aside). See §5 "Live text-size change".
- **States:** the screen's list in §6 below, each in Light and Dark.
- **Recordings:** the screen's signature motion (§9C Motion), plus one tap through every
  tappable element (§4).
- **The stress fixture** (§9B): 20-character names, ≥ $1,000,000 values and losses, the
  longest ticker and company names in the universe, 16 managers where a list allows it.
- **Where the evidence lives** (Giorgio, 2026-10-14: the repo stays small; `docs/design/captures/`
  had reached 216 MB and every retake adds to history):
  - **Stills and recordings stay OUT of the repo**, in `~/fantasy-stock-design-review/<branch>/`.
    Never `git add` a PNG, MOV or frame sheet under `docs/design/captures/`.
  - **The repo keeps only `docs/design/captures/<set>/README.md`**, pointing at that folder. It
    carries the build SHA every frame was taken on (one build per set: the gate checks
    status-bar times against commit times), the states table (each file with its state, theme,
    device and text size), the measurements, accent per frame, and the §2 / §3 / §4 tables.
  - Sets already committed (through Portfolio) stay where they are; nothing is rewritten.

## 2. The reference check (the plan's new step)

For each screen, a table: the board frame it builds (`#call-game-night`, Dark and Light), the
reference it borrows from (Dark: Sleeper / ESPN / Robinhood; Light: E*TRADE / Yahoo), and the
borrowed traits **present** or **absent**, with evidence (a capture and a point measurement).
The squint test is run against the **reference**, not against 1.2.0. The `ux-reviewer` adds
the row "resembles its reference?" with evidence.

## 3. Hallmark (adopted in `hallmark-notes.md`)

- **Self-critique** on the screen as built: Philosophy · Hierarchy · Execution · Specificity ·
  Earned · Variety (here: does the screen read as the same system as the screens already
  approved?), 1–5; any < 3 is a revision before the gate is sent.
- **`hallmark audit`** punch list on the captures: tell · where · severity (critical → P1,
  major → P2, minor → P3) · fix.

## 4. "Nothing tappable does nothing" (checked at every gate)

The full audit (W8) runs once after the whole redesign; each gate still checks its own screen:
a table of every element that looks tappable (rows, chips, pills, chevrons, avatars, the
league pill, tabs, links, the player card's actions) → what it does, captured in the tap-
through recording. Anything that can't act in the current state is **hidden**, or **disabled
with the reason beside it**. A silent no-op is a P1.

## 5. The §9C mechanical checks (measure, never eyeball)

| Check | How | Fail if |
|---|---|---|
| Tokens only | grep the branch's changed files for `#[0-9A-Fa-f]{3,8}` and `rgba(` outside `constants/tokens/` | any colour literal in a component |
| Every fill has its own ink | for each fill on the screen (accent, you, loss-fill, your-side tint, clock cell, category pills, the band of a chip), name the `on*` token its text reads | text on a fill reads page text (`text`/`text2`) |
| Contrast | the worker's `contrastPairs.ts` test green in both themes (110 checks per theme as of W3); the board's `TOKEN_ROWS`/`PAIRS` and `themes.css` updated in the same change | a red test, the two lists differ, or `themes.css` differs from `color.ts` |
| Accent by area | `python3 ~/fantasy-stock-design-review/tools/game-night/app_accent_area.py <capture> <dark\|light> docs/design/tokens-v3-game-night.json` on every capture; the README gives two numbers per frame, with and without the screen's one primary action | accent > 5% of a frame NOT counting the screen's single primary action (Design Lead, W4 Home gate 2026-10-13: the primary is what the accent is for; it is a full-width pill, §9C). Data colours are reported apart. A second accent-filled control counts. |
| No rule lines between rows | inspect the row stack in the capture at 1:1 | a divider line between list rows (separation is space, surface or your side's tint) |
| Depth | Dark: page / card / inset are lightness steps, no shadows; Light: white cards with the rim on the tinted page, the sheet's shadow only | a drop shadow on Dark; a card without its rim |
| Numbers | game numbers ExtraBold (800); the Portfolio value Medium (500); everything tabular | a condensed Black number in the app; proportional digits in a column |
| Lines | edge to edge, stops at now, end dot in `live` with its halo, base line dashed; the 0-point and 1-point states captured (e.g. Monday before the first close, a stock bought today). A one-point line: the dot at the RIGHT end (now), the y-scale centred on the base so the dot sits above or below it by its move (W4 Matchup and Home gates) | a blank frame, an axis or grid, a fill under a Game Night line; a lone dot pinned to a corner or clipped at the plot's edge |
| No sparklines on rows | Portfolio holdings, Matchup roster, watchlist, search rows | any small line on a row (the player card carries the lines) |
| Draft tiles | `surface` tile, the 3pt category line at the bottom, label row (pick · 3-letter code) | a colour-filled tile ("a carbon copy of Sleeper"); a sample sector instead of the app's category |
| Block rhythm | measured from pixels, glyph to glyph, in points (the existing gate step) | a flush stack; a gap off the token |
| Uppercase in the string | grep the changed files for `textTransform` | any `textTransform` (React Native measures before the transform and can clip the last glyph; uppercase with `.toUpperCase()`, §9C Type) |
| Shrink-to-fit floor | grep for `minimumFontScale` and check size × scale | any label that can shrink under 11pt; avatar initials under 11pt |
| 11pt floor, 44pt targets, drawn icons, colour never the only code | §9B (text tabs need `minWidth: 44`, not only `hitSlop`; range tabs are equal-width, as wide as the widest label + 16, so they space evenly, with the underline under the LABEL) | §9B |
| The standout stays loudest | at Large, XL and with the stress fixture, measure cap heights: the screen's standout number against every other text on the screen | any name, line, label or row figure rendering larger than the standout it belongs to. Shrink-to-fit numbers have no fixed size: cap the neighbour by the number's FITTED size (`stackedNameCap`), not by a flat multiplier. Known open case: at ≥ $1M and XL, Matchup's stacked row gains outgrow the scoreboard totals (W4 Matchup gate, P3), so check it at the League and Portfolio gates |
| One button shape | every sp Button variant and size, side by side on one card | two shapes on one surface: every Button is a pill (§9C; W4 Home gate) |
| Wrapping at XL | read every line that wraps at XL and XXXL | a line starting with "·", a date or "Week 6 of 14" split across lines (non-breaking spaces keep each "·" with the segment before it); a money amount broken inside itself ("$1,000." / "00", W8 gate 2026-10-16): an amount is one unbreakable run, and its unit ("a slot", "per slot") may wrap after it |
| A code on its own line | read every invite code at XXXL and AX5 with the longest real code | a code broken across lines ("ASC-0fc85d9" / "d"). A code by itself draws through `InviteCodeText` (one line, fit down to 0.6×, the PLAIN code: no joiners, which would double a tracked style's letter spacing and reach the copied text); a code inside a sentence that can wrap is `keepCode`-joined (2026-11-02). Its label never outranks it: the label is capped at the code's scale (`codeLabelMaxScale`) |
| Stacked rows read label, value, sub | every SettingRow that stacks (its label broke mid-word) at AX5 | the value separated from its label by the sub-line ("…after the season." / "You" reads as one sentence). Stacked order is label → value (with its chevron) → sub, the sub full width (2026-11-02); side by side, nothing moves |
| Live text-size change | the §1 live pass, cmp against cold | a text, a row or a sheet keeping its old size's box or layout (Fabric keeps a container's flex layout when only its Texts remount: key the CONTAINER's root by `fontScaleKey`, as SettingRow does). Accepted (2026-11-03): a FOCUSED field whose text overflows after a live size increase keeps its old scroll offset until the next keystroke or blur (a remount would drop the keyboard). Exempt by design (2026-11-03): credential fields (password, username, email) never remount on a size change, because iOS reads a remounted filled credential form as a sign-in and offers "Save Password?"; their glyphs correct on focus |
| Labels that can read as nonsense | the label in its emptiest real state (Week 1, nothing scored, no close yet) | "Through Week 0", "Ordered by …" before any close: hide a label that has nothing to name (no new copy) |

## 6. Per screen: the states to capture and what to check

### Home
- **States:** every calm-Home state (ux-audit "Captures for the gate", items 1–11) in both
  themes; "Your season" in each this-week state (live, market closed, scoring, scored, bye,
  playoff bye, playoff pending, eliminated, missed playoffs), with a tie, an unscored past week
  and week ≥ 10 (the opening scroll).
- **Check:** the team value is the one standout (`hero`, 46/800); This week is the rimmed card
  with 28pt scores and the "Live" chip; Standings is the rimmed card with your row's tint;
  24pt between blocks. **No chart on Home** (Giorgio, 2026-11-03, PRODUCT_RULES "No chart on
  Home"): the hero, This week, "Your season", Standings, in that order. "Your season": tiles of
  equal width, a played week's score on one line, this week's tile outlined and never showing a
  score (its ring is `text2`, its dot only while live), an unscored past week "–" (never W/L,
  never Bye), the row opening with this week in view and the next tile peeking. At AX5, This
  week is on the first screen.

### Matchup + the player card
- **States:** live while you lead and while you're BEHIND; final (won and lost); the reveal;
  Monday before the first close (rows in draft/slot order, every gain $0.00); an unslotted
  league (one list, best first, centre empty); a category league and a price-tier league
  (grouped by slot, the group header centred); a bye week; the playoffs; XL with the longest
  names.
- **Check:** the scoreboard is names, the two totals, who leads ("{name} leads by {margin}"),
  nothing else (no win %, bars, projections, records, chart); **your half and your roster
  column are shaded (`youTint`) in every state, win or lose, and nothing marks a row's winner**
  (Giorgio, 2026-10-12: "it's you … Not whoever's winning"); the order is recomputed at each
  market close and never re-sorts while you look (record a live update: the rows hold still);
  tap a row on either side → the player card.
- **The player card's states:** yours and theirs; drafted, bought and claimed ("How you got
  it" / "How they got it", at the BOTTOM, the price per share: "Drafted 2nd overall · Sep 29 ·
  $290.10", "Claimed off waivers · Oct 7 · $187.20", "Bought · Oct 2 · $214.80"); market open
  (yours: Sell, NEVER Save; theirs: Save / Saved) and closed (yours: Sell disabled with
  "Market's closed. Opens Mon 9:30 ET." beside it; theirs: Save); the owner's avatar inside the
  "Owned by" pill; a slotted league (the slot pill in the header); THREE key figures (Price ·
  Week gain · Since the draft, or "Since Oct 2" for a later buy); the season line on a date
  axis with no acquisition marker; this week on a Mon…Fri axis (days to come empty); a stock
  bought today (a 1-point season line, the full axis); XL; Reduce Motion (the sheet fades);
  VoiceOver reads the three figures with their labels.
- **Reference notes from Giorgio's own screenshots** (`~/fantasy-stock-design-review/
  references/espn-player-card-{1,2,3}.webp`): the owner's avatar is now drawn (approved); the
  week-by-week game log is "later" (not in this build); the gate does not flag its absence.
- **Carried from the W3 gate (2026-10-12): fixed before this gate is sent, each one checked.**
  - **The owner's disc shows ONE initial** (§9C Type: a disc under 24pt). Capture a wide pair
    ("Marco W." → "M") and "Gianluigi B." → "G" in both themes; a test in `sp-avatar.test.ts`.
  - **The card matches the board** (`directions.jsx`, the `PlayerCard` frame), three details:
    1. **"How you got it" sits in an `inset` panel** (radius 14, padding 12 / 14), its title as
       a `tag`-size label in `text2` (normal width, not the Expanded face), the line under it
       at 15/700, tabular. Not a headline over body text.
    2. **Save carries the drawn star** (18pt, outline) before the label. **Saved:** the same
       star filled, the label "Saved"; nothing else changes (no accent fill).
    3. **The Season title row carries its caption** on the right: "{entry price} → {price
       now}" ("$290.10 → $318.37") in `caption`, `text2`, tabular, on the title's baseline.
  - **No action can render without its handler.** Type `PlayerCardProps` so `onSell` is
    required for your own stock and `onToggleSave` for theirs (a discriminated union on
    `owner`); a disabled button only ever appears with its reason beside it. Every screen's X
    closes the sheet (the gallery's no-op X doesn't count, but no screen may copy it).
  - **RosterRow's VoiceOver label says whose half it is**: "Yours, NVDA …" / "Gianluigi B.,
    NKE …".
  - **The 4pt scale:** PlayerCard gap 14 → 16, Scoreboard padding 14 → 16, GroupHead 10 → 12
    and 5 → 4, RangePills tab gap 18 → 16 (measured glyph to glyph in the captures).
- **Not seen at W3, so first seen here** (the W3 captures were the gallery, inline):
  the card **as a sheet** (rising over `scrim`, Reduce Motion fades it; record both); **Sell
  enabled**, and the tap through it to the sell flow; **Save → Saved** and back; a
  **"Bought"** acquisition; a **price-tier slot pill** ("$100–$200") in the header; a stock
  **bought today** (the dated 0- and 1-point season line with its full axis); **VoiceOver**
  reading the three figures, the owner and the action; **XL** on the card (the figure labels
  wrap or hold at ≥ 11pt; "SINCE THE DRAFT" is the longest).

### Draft room + lobby
- **States:** on the clock (with the flash recorded in both themes), someone else's turn,
  after your pick, an auto-pick, the last 10 seconds, the room before the start, Draft
  complete; 16 managers; XL.
- **Check:** tiles per §5; the on-the-clock cell (`clockCell`, navy in both themes, the 2pt
  `live` ring, the pick number in `clockCellLive`); your turn in the accent (cyan / teal,
  decided); haptic and chime timing unchanged.

### League
- **States:** Standings in full (6 and 16 managers, ties, your row in the middle and at the
  bottom), Schedule, Playoffs (byes as rows of their round, GS-6; the champion row, GS-7),
  History; XL (names wrap onto two lines, the open P2).
- **Check:** each manager row a `surface` tile 6pt apart, your row `youTint` + the 1.5pt
  ring, bold name, no "(you)"; movement as drawn chevrons + number; season gain coloured by
  sign; no grid lines.

### Portfolio, the stock sheet, Buy a stock
- **States:** live, closed, cash from a sale, after a buy; the chart and range pills **only if
  Giorgio approves them** (open question); search with owned / available / no free slot rows.
- **Check:** the page is `moneyBg`; the value in `money` (Medium 500); no sparklines; the
  sector/slot pill on rows; the Alpaca credit on every price surface; the card opens from
  every row.

### Onboarding, invite, join
- **States:** each step; refusals (rule 8); the invite and the join preview (names nobody).
- **Check:** Yahoo's warmth in copy and avatars only; one primary per step; both themes.
- **Auth forms with the keyboard up** (Giorgio, 2026-11-09 and 2026-11-10; PRODUCT_RULES, Onboarding, "Sign-in and sign-up
  screens behave like a short native form"): capture each field focused at L and AX5. A focused field scrolls the
  minimum so it and its error or rules line clear the docked button; no gap between the last
  field and the button; nothing moves when the field already fits; at L, Email is still in view
  with Password focused. A form that fits neither scrolls nor bounces (try a drag at L). At AX5
  the docked footer shows only its main button while the keyboard is up, and the rules are
  capped at 1.3x. Superseded (do NOT pass it): "focused field to the top of the window" (#345).
  When the stack can't fit, the box wins (Giorgio, 2026-11-10): the message and rules give way,
  then the label, never the box. A form-level message (a refusal from the server, e.g. the
  email rate limit) sits in the scroll body under the fields, capped at 1.6x, in danger red, and
  is part of the focused field's reveal; never docked, never a WarnPanel; the fields themselves
  are not turned red unless they are wrong. A next step that is not a failure (Sign in's
  unconfirmed email) is a note in primary text, with the approved "Didn't receive it? Send
  again" as question (secondary) + action (accent). Nothing revealed may land inside the 10pt
  footer fade: the bottom breathing is the fade's height + 4.

## 7. Decided with Giorgio (2026-10-12), so a gate checks, never asks

Cyan your turn; "Since the draft"; the Portfolio chart and range pills; two end dates on Home;
price per share; the navy clock cell in Light; the owner's avatar on the card (the weekly log
later); the 11 categories; Matchup shading B (your side). A trait the reference check finds
absent that the board never drew is listed for Giorgio, not added.
